        <h1>Game Rules</h1>
        <p>1. Players: You need at least three people to play.</p>

        <p>
          2. Start: The person with the app reads the question, like "Never have
          I ever ridden a horse."
        </p>

        <p>
          3. Action: If you've done what the person said, you admit it by
          raising your hand, taking a drink
        </p>
        <p>4. Repeat: After you're done with the question, go to the next.</p>
        <p>
          5. End: There's no specific end point. You can stop whenever you want
          or keep playing for as long as you're having fun.
        </p>

        <p>
          Be Honest and Respectful: It's all about having a good time, so be
          honest but also respectful of each other's comfort levels.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's it! It's a simple game that's all about learning interesting
          things about your friends while having a laugh. Enjoy!
