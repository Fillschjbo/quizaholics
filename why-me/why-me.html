            <h1>Game Rules</h1>
            <p>
                "Why Me?!" is a hilarious party game that puts your assumptions and perceptions to the test! <br>
                Gather your friends, grab your favorite drinks, and get ready for some laughter-filled moments. <br>

                To play, each player takes turns drawing a card featuring a quirky statement or scenario. <br/>
                It could be anything from "Who's always glued to their phone?" to "Who's most likely to conquer the world?"<br>

                Once the card is revealed, it's up to the group to decide who among them best fits the description.<br>
                You can either take turns assigning the card to someone or, <br>
                for a more interactive twist, count down from three and point to the person you think fits the bill. <br>
                Majority rules! <br>

                But here's the catch: the chosen person must then take a sip of their drink for each card assigned to them. <br>
                So, whether you're being praised for your quirks or gently roasted for your habits, <br>
                every round is guaranteed to bring laughter and camaraderie. <br>

                With its simple yet entertaining gameplay, "Why Me?!" is the perfect icebreaker for any gathering, <br>
                ensuring a night filled with fun memories and inside jokes.
